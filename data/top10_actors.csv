He is of Russian Jewish descent. At 17, he took his first step towards becoming a stand-up comedian when he spontaneously took the stage at a Boston comedy club. He found he was a natural comic. He nurtured his talent while at New York University (graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1991) by performing regularly in clubs and at universities. During his freshman year, he snagged a recurring role as the Huxtable family's friend Smitty on La hora de Bill Cosby (1984). While working at a comedy club in L.A., he was ""discovered"" by Dennis Miller, who recommended him to Saturday Night Live (1975) producer Lorne Michaels and told him that Sandler had a big talent. This led to his being cast in the show in 1990, which he also wrote for in addition to performing. After Saturday Night Live (1975), Sandler went on to the movies, starring in such hit comedies as Cabezas huecas (1994), Terminagolf (1996), Billy Madison (1995) and Un papá genial (1999). He has also starred in Mr. Deeds (2002) alongside Winona Ryder; Ocho noches locas (2002), an animated movie about the Jewish festival of Chanukah; and Embriagado de amor (2002). He also writes and produces many of his own films and has composed songs for several of them, including El chico ideal (1998). Sandler has had several of his songs placed on the ""Billboard"" charts, including the classic ""The Chanukah Song"".";Actor | Producer | Writer;El aguador

 Maya Rudolph;https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzOTQwMzAyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA1OTc0._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg;"Maya Rudolph was born on July 27, 1972 in Gainesville, Florida, to Richard Rudolph, a music producer, and soul singer Minnie Riperton. Her mother was African-American and her father is Ashkenazi Jewish (from a family from Lithuania, Russia, Germany, and Hungary). In 1973, Maya, her parents, and her older brother, Marc Rudolph, moved to California to further Minnie's music career. Here Minnie recorded ""Lovin' You"", her most famous single, in which one can hear her sing ""Maya, Maya, Maya"" at the end of the song; Riperton said that the song was used as a lullaby for Maya.

During adolescence, Maya attended St. Augustine by the Sea School, where she met childhood friend, Gwyneth Paltrow. The Paltrows and the Rudolphs became family friends and, in 2000, Richard Rudolph and Maya filled the role of music supervisors on the Bruce Paltrow-directed film A dúo (2000), which starred Gwyneth.

In 1990, Maya enrolled at the University of California at Santa Cruz, majoring in photography. It was here that Maya formed the band ""Supersauce"" with fellow students. After graduation in 1994, Maya left the band and soon joined The Rentals, fronted by Weezer bassist Matt Sharp. Maya was featured on the 1999 release ""Seven More Minutes"", where she sang backup vocals on ""Barcelona"" and ""My Head is in the Sun"". Maya began touring with the group, singing backup and playing Moog synthesizer. When The Rentals disbanded, Maya decided to pursue her dream of a career in comedy, joining the famed troupe ""The Groundlings"".

On May 6, 2000, Maya joined the cast of Saturday Night Live (1975), and became one of that show's most popular performers. Famous sketches include a dead-on impression of fashion diva Donatella Versace; high school flake ""Megan"", the host of her own morning talk show, ""Wake-up WakeField""; and one of the members of the R&B parody ""Gemini's Twin"". In 2006, she co-starred in the film El último show (2006), directed by the legendary Robert Altman and based on the NPR show by Garrison Keillor.

His comedy has spawned national catchphrases, captured a global audience, and has launched him into the entertainment industry as a bonafide ""one to watch"".

Bachelor has starred in the films 50 sombras muy oscuras (2016), Los Black se van de purga (2016), The Babysitter (2017), and ¿Dónde está el dinero? (2017), and will appear in the upcoming films La primera vez que nos vimos (2018) and A todos los chicos de los que me enamoré (2018). Additional television credits include Dead House (2017), which he created, directed and executive produced, Easy (2016), Resident Advisors (2015), Black Jesus (2014), The Mindy Project (2012), and Angie Tribeca (2016).

Born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and raised in the U.S., he graduated from Florida State University with a degree in business in 2010. While attending FSU, he was a high-jump star athlete, consistently ranking among the top fifteen high-jumpers in the NCAA. After graduation, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue one of his greatest passions, a career as an actor. He took acting classes at the New York Film Academy in LA, and Bachelor established his own production company, Bach Enterprises, where he produced, directed, and performed in several projects including the short film Agent Steele (2012). In a few short years, he rose to be one of the most-followed people on Vine with 15 million subscribers and over 5 billion total views. His other social media channels also flourished, with tens of millions following his content.

In 2003, Bachelor founded The RuJohn Foundation, a non-profit organization with a mission to provide the necessary tools for education to rural and inner-city schools throughout Jamaica and the United States. The foundation also organizes annual youth-focused financial literary workshops, sports camps led by professional athletes, and acting workshops led by successful actors and entertainers.

Bachelor has been named one of the ""top influencers"" by both Forbes and Time, and in 2015 he received the Streamy Award for Viner of the Year. The following year, he won the Shorty Award for Viner of the Year, and in 2017 he was nominated for the Streamy Award for Storyteller of the Year.
